## Advice from Chid

There is a soil tiller that has a near-drill like tip. 
The difficulty for bowel preforation is very high.
Tend to use hands with a lot of oil, suppositories are used beforehand.

Bury the suppository deep within the stool burden to try to soften it,
then use hand to pull the stool out.

Difficulties - getting the finger deeply in enough to pull the stool out 
with as little pain and injury as possible. Very invasive and sensitive procedure
if the patient is awake then there is a lot of embarassment and discomfort.
Currently no device available that balances the perforation and discomfort and efficiency.

Testing/modeling - playdough clay is a good model, modeling clay is too firm, 

The rectum is mostly muscle, highly distensible, however the distension takes a lot of time, the diameter is a source of concern
however the lack of visible is also very important - tactile feedback from digital is important

The initial diameter would be a pain threshold 

litocain jelly instead of topical jelly - not considered risky enough for the pain in order to put the patient under
general anesthesia, 

Criticism of the ultrasonic design: Vibrating objects have natural planes of weakenesses, firm stools are discrete entities 
that require a lot of energy. Perhaps insert chemical in order to create a chemical reaction.

Criticism of the claw design: Mechanical design needs to be fixed inside the patient, and there is a moving part is inside the 
patient 

Very easy to push the stool up, the colon creates an S, so you can push up deeper and deeper inside the rectum
so the cylindrical idea might be ideal. But flexibility is very important. 

How important is pliability: Very important
