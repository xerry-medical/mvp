A small but consistent subset of the patient population suffers from constipation so severe that it is resistant to laxatives,

stool softeners, suppositories and even enemas. These patients are often elderly but also include younger people with

neuromuscular disease who are not longer able to generate the intestinal movements to soften and move stool along.

Manual disimpaction is one of the most lucrative procedures that an emergency room or nursing home physician can do and

involves pulling the stool out with the fingers and hand. This is often either painful or ineffectual, depending on the size and

dexterity of the physician's hand. There must be an easily utilized and packaged tool (such as the vaginal speculum is) to

help healthcare professionals accomplish this take effectively and tolerably.
